BDC Meta Man is the first Business Data Catalog tool for all SharePoint Developers and Administrators interested in line of business data integration with SharePoint. Without writing a single line of code you can be viewing and searching across your business data through Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 in minutes.
Business Data Catalog (BDC) allows to integrate business data from external business applications into SharePoint application. BDC has built-in support for displaying data from such data sources as databases and web services. In other words, if the business application is a database or comprises a web service to emit data, its data can be easily incorporated into SharePoint application. If some business application isn’t database and doesn’t have any proper web services, you always can develop your own web service to provide access to the business application’s data.

Once the external business application has been registered within Business Data Catalog, its data can be used in Business Data Web Parts, Business Data Column, Search, User profile and other custom solutions.</content>

3)A web part that renders out the required code to reference the CSS and JavaScript files, and also render out the contents of the HTML file (contained in a Site Collection feature)

One useful view of directories and files in a document library is the treeview. If we show other useful information like size and number of files in each directory, it will be more useful for the users.

In this, we will implement a treeview Web Part for the document library. Our intended features of this Web Part are:

1)The tree view will show all files and folders of a document library.
2)The size and number of files in each directory will be shown for users as a tool tip of each directory.
3)User can select and change his target document library in an easy and graphical view.

                <content>Soap based web service is a software designed to support interoperable program-to-program interactions over a network. In the context of Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2007, a Web service is a service that returns XML data in response to remote procedure call–type queries. With SharePoint Designer 2007, you can interact with existing Web services by including an XML Web Service data source control on your Web pages. Typically you do this by configuring an XML Web Service as a data source and then by creating Data Views of that data,
Web services are used in a range of application-integration and data-sharing scenarios because they provide interoperability between software components that can reside on different platforms or in different companies. A Web service performs a specific task, in which information is requested by the client computer and returned by the Web service in the form of XML. Some common examples of XML Web services are currency converters, mortgage calculators, and stock quote reports.

XML Web services are made possible by SOAP, a standards-based protocol that is used for exchanging information in XML format over a computer network. Each Web service includes a Web Service Description Language (WSDL) file that contains information about the XML Web service and its capabilities. Web service providers can register their Web services by using Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI), a specification for publishing and locating information about Web services. Interested users can search the UDDI registry for Web services that they might find helpful. After a Web service is added to a Web site, the information about that Web service is displayed by using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</content>

                <content>Tag cloud is merely a collection of terms, typically used as &quot;tags&quot; or &quot;keywords&quot;.  These terms are represented graphically.  Font sizes are increased for popular tags and decreased for less popular tags.  A tag cloud is a &quot;heat map&quot; for keywords, enabling users at a glance to scan a list of terms. Here's the classic example from Flicker:This tag cloud represents the all time most popular tags associated with photos uploaded to Flicker.  From this simple display, you can imply statements like &quot;wedding photos are more popular pictures.
    
Tag clouds are good for discovery in an unbounded set of results. The primary point here is that tag clouds are a great way to depict a large and unpredictable set of tags, terms and topics. However tag clouds are much less suitable when your universe of possible tags is small or finite. If you're dealing with just 10-20 possible tags, do your users a favour and stick with a frequency distribution, histogram or ranked list of categories.
    
Tag clouds should almost always be used as supporting or redundant navigation. Whenever possible I would recommend providing users with a logical, hierarchical browsing structure first, and adding a tag cloud to increase discovery second.  This tag clouds makes a great addition to SharePoint. SharePoint is great at providing highly structured vertical pathing to resources. Adding tag clouds to SharePoint increases discoverability and helps address the chronic problem of finding all of the useful content that gets neatly filed away in your portal.
    
Tag clouds work best on highly dynamic data sets. Tag clouds are most interesting when they change regularly. AJAX enabled tag cloud that updates on the fly would be incredibly great.

                <content>User control is a control that is associated with a .ASCX extension and was originally intended for a developer to re-use within a single project.  ASP.NET developers know it is really easy to create a new user control, drag and drop some controls onto a visual designer, put some logic in the control’s code-behind, and re-use the control within a single project.  This is because the .ASCX file associated with the control enables you to create markup for your control:
Because you can add markup for your control, you get the nice WYSIWYG designers for your control.  This allows you to drag items from the toolbox, such as a button, a label, and a text box.  
Another nice feature of user controls is that you can quickly add event handlers for your control.  For instance, I double-click the button to add some code-behind, and Visual Studio pops up the code editor to allow me to add some code.
Notice that our code-behind derives from System.Web.UI.UserControl.  For existing ASP.NET developers, you will be happy to see that it’s the same old UserControl class that’s been there since ASP.NET was introduced.  By using the .ASCX, Visual Studio 2007 provides the same WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop features that you have with ASP.NET development.  In your SharePoint 2007 project, add a new User Control to your project, add the markup to the .ASCX file, and put some code in the code-behind. </content>

                <content>Wiki creation is a site that is designed for groups of people to quickly capture and share ideas by creating simple pages and linking them together. After someone creates a page, another team member can add more content, edit the content, or add supporting links. The community of authors helps to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the content. Wikis continue to evolve as people add and revise information.
