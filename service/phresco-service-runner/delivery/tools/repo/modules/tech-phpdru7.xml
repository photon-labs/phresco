                <content>Blocks are the boxes of content (such as &quot;User Login&quot; or &quot;Who's online&quot;) that can be displayed in regions (such as footer or sidebar) on your page. Blocks are made available to your site most commonly by enabling modules. Once created, a Block can be modified to adjust its appearance, shape, size and position - or which Website pages it appears on. For example, enabling the core Poll module makes the &quot;Most Recent Polls&quot; block available for you to place in a region. The block management screen also provides checkboxes (depending on your version of Drupal and what modules you have enabled), as well as a configure link, which takes you to the configuration screen. The checkboxes and configuration page let you customize the visibility of the block. A block's visibility depends on:

1) Whether it is Enabled and assigned to a region. Disabled blocks (blocks not assigned to any region in your theme) are never shown.
2) Page-specific visibility settings. Individual blocks can be configured to only show/hide on certain pages. You can also show/hide blocks based on the result of a PHP snippet.
3)Custom visibility settings. Individual blocks can be configured so that users decide whether to show/hide certain blocks.
4)This  function. Dynamic blocks (such as those defined by modules) may be empty on certain pages and will not be shown.

The block management screen also has an &quot;Add block&quot; link. This allows you to define a block containing content of your choice. Each administrator-defined block consists of a title, a description, and a body which can be as long as you wish; the Drupal engine will render the content of the block.

This module uses the Field API to generate dynamic data tables for entities and fields. While this is a required core module, it may be replaced by other contributed modules that implement The Field Storage API.

Field API:-The Field API allows custom data fields to be attached to Drupal entities and takes care of storing, loading, editing, and rendering field data. Any entity type (node, user, etc.) can use the Field API to make itself &quot;fieldable&quot; and thus allow fields to be attached to it. Other modules can provide a user interface for managing custom fields via a web browser as well as a wide and flexible variety of data type, form element, and display format capabilities.

The Field API defines two primary data structures, Field and Instance, and the concept of a Bundle. A Field defines a particular type of data that can be attached to entities. A Field Instance is a Field attached to a single Bundle. A Bundle is a set of fields that are treated as a group by the Field Attach API and is related to a single fieldable entity type.

                <content>Filter module allows you to configure formats for text input for your site. When users create or edit content, they can choose between the input formats you make available to their user role. You can configure which formats are available to which user roles, as well as choose a default input format. You can also create new input formats. And you can configure each input format to use your choice of filters.Despite the name &quot;filter,&quot; the module not only lets you keep out text you don't want but also lets you enhance the text you let in. So, for example, you can use a filter to turn ordinary line breaks into HTML paragraph tags.when you specify more than one format for a filter you can specify the order in which they are processed.

                <content>Node is any posting, such as a page, poll, article, forum topic, or blog entry.Content on a drupal website is stored and treated as &quot;nodes.&quot;  Treating all content as nodes allows the flexibility of creating new types of content. It also allows you to painlessly apply new features or changes to all content.

Behind the scenes, the nodes module manages these nodes. This module is what lets you:
1) List, sort through, and manage all the content on your site.
2) Set defaults for how all posts are displayed.
3) List and configure the &quot;content types&quot; for your site, and create new ones.
Offering &quot;content types&quot; is a way Drupal allows you to have different kinds of nodes for different purposes. For example, an &quot;article&quot; is one kind of node, a &quot;book page&quot; another, and a &quot;blog entry&quot; yet another. You can also create new content types of your own.
The Node module manages the creation, editing, deletion, settings, and display of the main site content. Content items managed by the Node module are typically displayed as pages on your site, and include a title, some meta-data (author, creation time, content type, etc.), and optional fields containing text or other data. (Fields are managed by the Field module in Drupal 7.)

The user module allows users to register, login, and log out. Users benefit from being able to sign on because it associates content they create with their account and allows various permissions to be set for their roles. The user module supports user roles which establish fine grained permissions allowing each role to do only what the administrator wants them to each user is assigned to one or more roles. 

By default there are two roles anonymous - a user who has not logged in, and authenticated a user who has signed up and who has been authorized. Users can use their own name or handle and can specify personal configuration settings through their individual My account page. Users must authenticate by supplying a local username and password or through their OpenID, an optional and secure method for logging into many websites with a single username and password. In some configurations, users may authenticate using a username and password from another Drupal site, or through some other site-specific mechanism.</content>

Blogs are made up of individual posts that are time stamped and are typically viewed by date as you would view a journal. Blog entries can be made public or private to the site members, depending on which roles have access to view content.

Note that the blog module is not necessary for a &quot;single-user&quot; blog, that is a site that only has one individual blogging (the most common situation). For that it's easy to create a custom content type that will accommodate. Blog module is usually used when there is a need for &quot;multi-user&quot; blogs, where many different blogs, written by different users are all running on one site.

Through contact forms, users allow themselves to be contacted yet keep their own e-mail addresses private until the message is replied to. As an administrator, you can enable or disable the contact module altogether.

As a user, you can also enable or disable your personal contact form if that option has been provided. When the form is enabled, a contact tab is displayed in your user profile, for everyone to see. (Privileged users such as site administrators can contact users who have turned their forms off, as they can access their user account email addresses.)

This is similar to a message board system such as phpBB. Forums are very useful because they allow community members to discuss topics with one another, and the discussions are archived for future reference.Topics, or threaded discussions, are posted to a forum. Each topic is comprised of an initial post and replies, or comments. Forum topics can have their own URLs.

Multiple forums are often set up for different areas of discussion. Forums can also be placed inside other forums for a discussion area that is a subset of the parent forum, in which case they are often called child boards or child forums.Containers can also be created to hold a group of forums. However, unlike in parent forums, topics cannot be posted to containers. Both containers and forums can be placed inside other containers and forums. By planning the structure of your containers and forums well, you make it easier for users to find a discussion area of interest to them.</content>

                <content>Locale adds language handling functionality and enables the translation of the user interface to languages other than English. When enabled, the Locale core module allows you to present your Drupal site in a language other than the default English. You can use it to set up a multilingual web site or to replace the elements of the interface text with text which has been customized for your site. Whenever the Locale module encounters text, it tries to translate it into the currently selected language. If a translation is not available, the string is remembered, so you can look up untranslated strings easily.

The Locale module provides two options for providing translations. The first is the integrated web interface, which you can used to search for untranslated strings and to specify their translations. An easier and less time-consuming method is to import existing translations for your language. These translations are available as GNU gettext Portable Object files (.po files for short). You can download translation files from the Drupal translations server.

If an existing translation does not meet your needs, the .po files are easily edited with special editing tools. The Locale module's import feature allows you to add strings from such files into your site's database. The export functionality enables you to share your translations with others, generating Portable Object files from your site strings.</content>

The Menu module provides an interface to control and customize the powerful menu system that comes with Drupal. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links using Drupal's highly flexible blocks feature. Each menu automatically creates a block of the same name. By default, new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labeled Navigation, but administrators can also create custom menus.

user can add, remove and rename menus and menu items. You can also configure a special block for a menu and you can specify the default menu to which new items will be added.In many themes there are at least two menus, the Main (or primary) menu, and a secondary menu. The Main menu's links drive the main navigation structure for your site, and are often displayed prominently across the top or side of the site. The Secondary menu is often used for items like the copyright and privacy notices and are often displayed at the bottom or very top of the page in smaller text. You can specify which menus are used for the main and secondary links.

When adding or editing site content, you can also specify the content's menu item. user can specify a default menu for the content authoring form. Each default or custom menu has a corresponding block.</content>

The OpenID module adds a feature to the User login block and displays a new link allowing a user to sign in using OpenID. OpenID is a secure method for logging into many websites with a single username and password. It does not require special software, and it does not share passwords with any site to which it is associated; including your site.

Users can create Drupal accounts using their OpenID. This lowers the barrier to registration, which is good for the site, and offers convenience and security to the users. OpenID is not a trust system, so email verification is still necessary. The benefit stems from the fact that users can have a single password that they can use on many websites. This means they can easily update their single password from a centralized location, rather than having to change dozens of passwords individually.</content>

                <content>Path allows users to rename URLs. The core Path module lets you optionally create URL aliases for your Drupal pages. By default, Drupal automatically creates web addresses like http://www.example.com/?q=node/67, which are not user- or search engine-friendly. Search engines will give better rankings to pages that have more human-friendly URLs, especially if they include relevant keywords - for instance, http://www.example.com/?q=all-about-tarantulas.

Using Path module:

1)Set the path for an individual node with the Path module (on the node/add or node edit form).
2) Add a URL alias at Administer &gt; Configuration &gt; Search and metadata &gt; URL aliases in Drupal 7, Administer &gt; Site building &gt; URL aliases &gt; add alias in Drupal 6.
3)Administer the list of URL aliases at Administer &gt; Configuration &gt; Search and metadata in Drupal 7; Administer &gt; Site building &gt; URL aliases in Drupal 6.

When combined with using Drupal's &quot;Clean URLs&quot; feature http://www.example.com/?q=all-about-tarantulas becomes www.example.com/all-about-tarantulas, which is the ideal readable form.</content>

In Content search, if you enter more than one search term the search module will look for content that has all the terms you've entered. If instead you want either one term or another, join your terms with &quot;or.&quot; If you're looking for an exact phrase, enclose it in quotation marks.

With Advanced Search you can also look for &quot;any of these words&quot; or &quot;this phrase,&quot; or both, you can rule out words you don't want, and you can choose content types within which to confine your search.</content>

The Statistics module shows you how often a given page is viewed, who viewed it, the previous page the user visited (referrer URL), and when it was viewed. These statistics are useful in determining how users are visiting and navigating your site.

To enable collection of statistics, the Enable access log checkbox on the Statistics settings page must be checked. This access log is used to store data about every page accessed, such as the remote host's IP address, where they came from (referrer), what node they've viewed, and their user name. Enabling the log adds one database call per page displayed by Drupal.

The Discard access logs older than setting on the settings page specifies the length of time entries are kept in the log before they are deleted. This setting requires a correctly configured cron maintenance task to run.

Enable Count content views to turn on and off the node-counting functionality of this module. If it is turned on, an extra database query is added for each node displayed, which increments a counter.</content>

The Trigger module provides the ability to take a particular action when a trigger occurs. Actions include functional tasks that are defined by Drupal core modules, and advanced actions that can be defined by the system administrator. Contributed modules can introduce new actions. Some examples of actions are sending an email, publishing a node, banning a user or promoting a node to the front page of a website. Triggers are defined by modules, and typically result from some characteristic change in an entity maintained by that module. Some examples of triggers are: deleting content, adding a comment, a user has logged in, or adding a term. In addition to the triggers provided by Drupal core modules, more triggers may be added by installed contributed modules.

Trigger module allows you to perform useful tasks by associating actions with specific triggers, such as e-mailing an administrator (the action) when a user account is deleted (the trigger), or automatically unpublishing a comment (the action) if the added comment (the trigger) contains certain words.</content>

                <content>Chaos tool suite is primarily a set of APIs and tools to improve the developer experience. It also contains a module called the Page Manager whose job is to manage pages. In particular it manages panel pages, but as it grows it will be able to manage far more than just Panels..A library of helpful tools by Merlin of Chaos.For the moment, it includes the following tools:

1)Plugins -- tools to make it easy for modules to let other modules implement plugins from .inc files.
2)Exportables -- tools to make it easier for modules to have objects that live in database or live in code, such as 'default views'.
3)AJAX responder -- tools to make it easier for the server to handle AJAX requests and tell the client what to do with them.
4)Form tools -- tools to make it easier for forms to deal with AJAX.
5)Object caching -- tool to make it easier to edit an object across multiple page requests and cache the editing work.
6)Contexts -- the notion of wrapping objects in a unified wrapper and providing an API to create and accept these contexts as input.
7)Modal dialog -- tool to make it simple to put a form in a modal dialog.
8)Dependent -- a simple form widget to make form items appear and disappear based upon the selections in another item.
9)Content -- pluggable content types used as panes in Panels and other modules like Dashboard.
10)Form wizard -- an API to make multi-step forms much easier.
11)CSS tools -- tools to cache and sanitize CSS easily to make user-input CSS safe.

Providing comment notifications for anonymous users is an important tool in bringing anonymous users back to your site, which helps convert anonymous users to registered users. Anonymous comment notification is a critical tool in building a blog comment community; all the major blogging platforms include this functionality.Many other notification modules do not allow notifications for anonymous users but comment notify does.

                <content>Rules module allows site administrators to define conditionally executed actions based on occurring events (known as reactive or ECA rules). It's a replacement with more features for the trigger module in core and the successor of the Drupal 5 workflow-ng module.It allows site administrators to define conditionally executed actions based on occurring events.

Features

1)Obviously, you may use reaction rules to react upon any event with custom conditions and actions.
2)Allows functionality to be re-used via components (Drupal 6: Rule sets only).
3)Flexible scheduling system that allows scheduling any component / action.
4)Users can share their customizations by using the built-in import/export feature. For that the module also integrates with Features.
5)Modular input evaluation system - for example you can install the Token module and use it in every action.
6)The module has been developed with site performance in mind, so it makes use of caching routines to speed up rule evaluation.
7)Rules 2.x (Drupal 7 only) features improved APIs, a new admin UI, support for all entity types, parameter configuration via simple data selection (i.e. just pass node:author as argument) and much more. See this blog post for more details.

                <content>GlobalRedirect is a simple module which checks the current URL for an alias and does a 301 redirect to it if it is not being used..Searches for an alias of the current URL and 301 redirects if found. Stops duplicate content arising when path module is enabled..Searches for an alias of the current URL.

Checks the current URL for a trailing slash, removes it if present and repeats check 1 with the new request. 
1)Checks if the current URL is the same as the site_frontpage and redirects to the frontpage if there is a match. 
2)Checks if the Clean URLs feature is enabled and then checks the current URL is being accessed using the clean method rather than the 'unclean' method. 
3)Checks access to the URL. If the user does not have access to the path, then no redirects are done. This helps avoid exposing private aliased node's. 
4)Make sure the case of the URL being accessed is the same as the one set by the author/administrator. For example, if you set the alias &quot;articles/cake-making&quot; to node/123, then the user can access the alias with any combination of case. 
5)Most of the above options are configurable in the settings page. In Drupal 5 you can access this after enabling the globalredirect_admin module. In Drupal 6, the settings page is bundled into the module.

2)Optionally create a link to full size images from the resized inline versions.
3)Prevents inline &quot;hot linking&quot; of images from other sites by storing them locally.
4)Adds height and width attributes to inline images when your users are too lazy to add them.

This module does not seek to be a full-blown e-commerce system, so it will never provide a shopping cart or other e-commerce tools.Rather, it allows developers to build e-commerce systems, using this module for the payment gateway.Out of the box, you can configure the system to require payment to view or create given content. Paypal API manages a simple ledger to control user access to paid content.Payments may be configured to be made either through a Pay Now button you create through your Paypal account, or Paypal API can create them for you.

If you choose to use the Paypal API, you will need to store your Paypal account email in your Drupal web site. Use of Pay Now buttons created through your control panel do not have this requirement.Either way, the Paypal API module handles your IPN (instant payment notification) for you, and you may create custom code in your own module to handle the payment notification (through hook_paypal_api_ipn()) or else query Paypal API as necessary. See paypal_api.api.php in this package for more documentation.

                <content>Star Rating is a simple module that provides star rating field and display formatter using Drupal 7's Field Type API.It provides star rating field type and formatter Unlike Fivestar module and other voting/rating module, it supports neither end user voting nor nice AJAX interface. It is inteded for the rating only by the author of the article (node). Of course, you may be able to do this with Fivestar module and other voting/rating modules, but unlike most of them, it does not require other modules such as voting API module. It's born to be simple but good enough for those who want star rating only by authors.

For example, if you are creating a restaurant review web site and you want to add three 5 star ratings (food, price and service) with different icon type for each rating within a node, then this module would be the best match.

Features

1)Very simple and no other modules required.
2)Utilizes Drupal 7's Field API.
3)Fully supports Views module.
4)Different icon type and color can be assigned for each field and each view mode. (Total 16 icon type x 8 colors = 128 different icons)

The goal of this project is to reduce the overhead of developers and site maintainers in keeping their jQuery plugins up-to-date and compatible with a given version of Drupal core. It is increasingly common for multiple Drupal modules and themes to require (or optionally use) the same jQuery plugin. So it can make sense for these components to have a dependency on one tiny module which provides the plugin. There would also be overhead (in CVS maintenance, PHP code, etc.) in having a Drupal module for each plugin, so this project bundles multiple plugins in one module.</content>

Three styles/types of menus are currently possible: 
1)Horizontal
2)Menus drop down.
3)Vertical.
4)Menus fly to the left.
5)Vertical.
6)Menus fly to the right. 

Nice Menus creates blocks that may be associated with any existing site menu which can be placed wherever normal blocks can be placed in a theme. For themers, it is also possible to theme a menu as a Nice Menu directly by using the provided theme functions so a block is not necessary. A specific theme function for the Primary Links menu is available. The theme functions also allow a developer to pass in a custom menu tree of their making (i.e. not using a Drupal menu.) There is more information on how to use theme functions in the documentation.

The module comes with a simple, generic color scheme which can be fully overridden either by adding the override CSS to the theme's normal stylesheet or by creating a Nice Menus CSS file and telling Nice Menus to use that rather than its own default one through the global theme configuration.

                <content>Node Queue queue creates a queue for each Nodequeue using Nodequeue's own smartqueue capability.

Use case: 
User have a set of nodequeues. Within each nodequeue, User want to be able to indicate particular nodes as special within that nodequeue. This module automatically creates a smartqueue based on the other nodequeues available.Still very rough around the edges but that basic functionality is there in the initial 1.0 release: When user  create a Nodequeuequeue queue, it will create sub-queues based on your other nodequeues (not Nodequeue queues, as that would start an infinite loop).Additionally, when an item is added to the Nodequeue queue smartqueue, it will automatically be added to the original queue that inspired it. (It does not yet remove items from the smartqueue when they are removed from the inspiration queue. As my initial use case was for subqueues of just one node each, this cleanup didn't matter much, but that feature is planned.)

User can create a block on your site containing multiple tabs with corresponding content. Clicking on the tabs makes the corresponding content display instantly, using jQuery. With the 6.x-2.x branch, this can be done in either ajax or non-ajax mode. if user choose ajax mode for your Quick Tabs block (and this is chosen on an individual QT basis), only the content of the active tab will be loaded on page load and the content of the other tabs will be loaded via ajax on tab click (this is good for performance if you are loading, for example, several large views). In non-ajax mode the tab content is just hidden / shown on tab-click. This latter method is an ideal way to do something like the Most Popular / Most Emailed stories tabs you see on many news websites, where it is used more as a space-saving device in your sidebar. If however, you want a QT block as the main content of your entire page, then the chances are that ajax mode will be more appropriate.Once created, the Quick Tabs blocks show up in your block listing, ready to be configured and enabled like other blocks. Multiple Quick Tabs blocks can be placed on a single page.</content>

                <content>Views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers to control how lists and tables of content (nodes in Views 1, almost anything in Views 2) are presented.

When installing Views on Drupal 7, User should have the current stable version of CTools (currently rc1) and you may need to flush cache as much as twice. There are currently issues with core's cache flushing that means one cache flush isn't necessarily enough. What is Views The Views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers to control how lists and tables of content (nodes in Views 1, almost anything in Views 2) are presented. Traditionally, Drupal has hard-coded most of this, particularly in how taxonomy and tracker lists are formatted.This tool is essentially a smart query builder that, given enough information, can build the proper query, execute it, and display the results. It has four modes, plus a special mode, and provides an impressive amount of functionality from these modes.

Among other things, Views can be used to generate reports, create summaries, and display collections of images and other content.
You need Views if

1)User like the default front page view, but you find you want to sort it differently.
2)User  like the default taxonomy/term view, but you find you want to sort it differently; for example, alphabetically.
3)User use /tracker, but you want to restrict it to posts of a certain type.
4)User like the idea of the 'article' module, but it doesn't display articles the way you like.
5)User want a way to display a block with the 5 most recent posts of some particular type.
6)Userwant to provide 'unread forum posts'.
7)User want a monthly archive similar to the typical Movable Type/Wordpress archives that displays a link to the in the form of &quot;Month, YYYY (X)&quot; 8)where X is the number of posts that month, and displays them in a block. The links lead to a simple list of posts for that month. 

Views can do a lot more than that, but those are some of the obvious uses of Views.

                <content>VotingAPI helps developers who want to use a standardized API and schema for storing, retrieving, and tabulating votes for Drupal content. VotingAPI is a framework for content voting and rating systems in Drupal. VotingAPI helps developers who want to use a standardized API and schema for storing, retrieving, and tabulating votes for Drupal content.

Among other things, it supports:
1)Rating of any content (comments, nodes, users, fish, whatever)
2)Multi-criteria voting (rate a game based on video, audio, and replayability)
3)Automatic tabulation of results (with support for different voting styles, like 'percentage' and '+1/-1')
4)Efficient caching of results (sorting and filtering doesn't require any recalculation)
5)Hooks for additional vote calculations

Note that this module does NOT directly expose any voting mechanisms to end users. It's a framework designed to make life easier for other developers, and to standardize voting data for consumption by other modules (like Views).

Wysiwyg module is capable to support any kind of client-side editor. It can be a HTML-editor (a.k.a. WYSIWYG), a &quot;pseudo-editor&quot; (buttons to insert markup into a textarea), or even Flash-based applications. The editor library needs to be downloaded separately. Various editors are supported (see below). Wysiwyg module also provides an abstraction layer for other Drupal modules to integrate with any editor. This means that other Drupal modules can expose content-editing functionality, regardless of which editor you have installed.

                <content>Mollom is an &quot;intelligent&quot; content moderation web service.Mollom handles incoming posts intelligently, in much the same way a human moderator decides what posts are acceptable.Mollom is in a unique position to determine if a post is potentially spam; not only based on the posted content, but also on the past activity and reputation of the poster. In short, Mollom handles incoming posts intelligently, in much the same way a human moderator decides what posts are acceptable. Therefore, Mollom enables you to allow anonymous users to post comments and other content on your site.

How it works:
Mollom may block a post outright if it is from a known spammer. If Mollom is unsure how to classify a post, it may require the completion of a CAPTCHA to accept the post. Posts that do not match a &quot;spammy&quot; text pattern and do not originate from known spammers are accepted without the need to complete a CAPTCHA. Essentially, Mollom acts as a proactive content moderator that is on the job 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
A stand-alone CAPTCHA solution, which neither considers user behavior nor point of origin, can never achieve this level of informed protection, and generally requires users to solve a CAPTCHA on every post. Using Mollom's text analysis, users must only solve CAPTCHAs when Mollom is unsure about a post.The Mollom module allows other modules to integrate their forms with Mollom. Forms exposed by Drupal core, including the user registration and comment forms, are supported by default. Mollom is actively developed and maintained by Dries Buytaert, the founder and project lead of Drupal, and Benjamin Schrauwen. Mollom is currently used by more than 30,000 sites, including Sony, Adobe, LinuxJournal, Warner Bros Records, Netlog, NBC, and others. As of September, 2010, Mollom currently protects over 30,000 websites with an average efficiency rate of 99.93% - which means that only 7 in 10,000 spam messages are not routinely caught by Mollom's filters. Since Mollom began operating, it has prevented almost 300 million spam posts from littering the web.

(Feeling the power yet? :) ) User can also choose whether to store your computed field values in the database with other content fields, or have them &quot;calculated&quot; on the fly during node views. (Although you should note that Views use requires database stored values.) This field is literally the Swiss Army knife of CCK fields. So start cooking up your PHP based values!

Please note that this is not the place to get support for D7 Fields! We are getting a number of support requests, bug reports, and even feature requests for D7 fields. Fields are in core in D7, you must file issues there, not here.

The D7 version of the contrib CCK package currently contains:

D6 -&gt; D7 data migration code, see Migrating D6 Content Construction Kit (CCK) to D7 Fields for an explanation of how to upgrade your data.
some miscellaneous helpers to do things that core will not do, like maintain the PHP code snippets some fields may have been using to define allowed values (partially working)

The following features are now handled by separate, dedicated projects:

1)nodereference and userreference : References project - co-maintainer needed.
2)content_permissions: Field permissions module. See this issue for progress on the D7 version..
3)fieldgroup : Field group module - with much more awesomeness than in D6 !
4)content_copy: Either use Bundle copy or the Features module which supports exporting and importing content types and fields in 'feature' modules. 

Integration with other modules:

1)Views - all Views field integration is handled by Views in D7.
2)Panels - all Panels field integration is handled by Panels in D7.
3)Token - see the D7 version of the Token module.
4)Devel - the Devel module will handle field generation code in D7.

Everything else is in Drupal 7 core. CCK Resources

CCK is a very powerful system with many different contributed modules to extend its functionality. Install the Advanced Help module for additional help, and use the Views module to display CCK information in a variety of ways.

Here are a few other comprehensive documentation and tutorial resources to help get you started:

1)Text: The CCK Handbook on Drupal.org.
2)Text: CCK Module basics tutorial.
3)Video: Adding Fields With CCK video.
4)Video: CCK &amp; Views Tutorial (for Drupal 5).
5)DVD: Learning CCK in-depth training by Lullabot.
6)Book: Using Drupal O'Reilly covers CCK with lots of examples.

No new features are planned for these versions, but they are still supported and bug reports are encouraged. In addition to breadcrumb visibility, this version provides an option that permits php code snippets to be used to form the breadcrumb titles and paths. Multiple languages are also supported.

                <content>Entity API module extends the entity API of Drupal core in order to provide a unified way to deal with entities and their properties. Additionally, it provides an entity CRUD controller, which helps simplifying the creation of new entity types.

Features:

This is an API module, so it doesn't provide any end-user features. However, users may enable the entity tokens module, which provides token replacements for all entity properties that have no tokens and are known to the entity API.

Overview:

1)The module provides API functions allowing modules to create, save, delete, view or to determine access for any entity, i.e. entity_create(), entity_save(), entity_delete(), entity_view() and entity_access().

2)The entity API introduces a unique place for metadata about entity relationships and entity properties: hook_entity_property_info(). This information about entity properties contains the data type and callbacks for how to get and set the data of a property. Modules may rely on this information in order to support any entity property, e.g. Rules and the Search API build upon that.

3)Furthermore the module provides data wrappers that make use of the available information to provide a simple and unified access to entities and their properties. For usage examples have a look at the README or the provided tests.

4)Beside that, the module helps you defining a new entity type. For that, it provides an entity controller, which implements full CRUD functionality for your entities. Optionally, entities may be created based on classes derived from the provided Entity class.

5)The entity API cares about creating fieldable entities as well as exportable entities, however it does not yet support revisions. Additionally it supports implementing bundle entities, i.e. bundle objects (like node types) for fieldable entities implemented as (exportable) entities, for which the appropriate field API callbacks get automatically invoked.

6)For entity types implemented based upon the provided CRUD API the API is providing additional module integration too, i.e. Rules events are provided for all CRUD-related hooks, some basic entity property information for hook_entity_property_info() is provided and exportable entities are automatically integrated with the Features module.

7)These module integrations are implemented in separate controller classes, which may be separately overridden or enabled/deactivated.
Optionally, the entity API also helps providing an administrative interface for managing entities, e.g. the UI for managing profile types of Profile 2 is built with that.

            <document documentType="DESCRIPTION">
                <content>Flag is a flexible flagging system that is completely customizable by the administrator. Using this module, the site administrator can provide any number of flags for nodes, comments, or users. Some possibilities include bookmarks, marking important, friends, or flag as offensive. With extensive views integration, you can create custom lists of popular content or keep tabs on important content.

Flags may be per-user, meaning that each user can mark an item individually, or global, meaning that the item is either marked or it is not marked, and any user who changes that changes it for everyone.

In this way, additional flags (similar to published and sticky) can be put on nodes, or other items, and dealt with by the system however the administration likes.
Features

Create unlimited arbitrary flags or bookmarks to flag content
Extensive Views integration to make lists of popular flagged content
Full support for Tokens in all messages and labels
Execute Actions when content is flagged past a certain threshold (Actions is now included in Drupal 6 core with no additional modules, requires 2.x version in Drupal 5)
Full Rules module integration
JavaScript based toggling of flags
Limit flag display by content type and roles
Optionally show each flag as a checkbox on the node form

Each flag provides data to the Views module, and provides a default view to list 'my bookmarks'. The default views are basic, but are easily tailored to whatever the system administrator would like them to do.

The module will come installed with a simple bookmark and two sample views for 'My bookmarks' both as a stand-alone page at &quot;bookmarks&quot;, and a page for each user as a tab under their profile at user/x/bookmarks.

Levels can be labeled, you can configure limit the number of items that can be selected, configure a title for the dropbox, choose a site-wide animation delay, and so on. You can even create new items and levels through Hierarchical Select!

            </document>
            <document documentType="DESCRIPTION">
                <content>Lightbox2 module is to overlay images on the current page. The module places images above your current page, not within. This frees you from the constraints of the layout, particularly column widths. It keeps users on the same page. Clicking to view an image and then having to click the back button to return to your site is bad for continuity (and no fun!). 

Features:

The version 2 module has several benefits over the plain Lightbox module. Note, not all of these features are available when the &quot;Lightbox2 Lite&quot; option is enabled.

1)Image Sets: group related images and navigate through them with ease - ideal for your image galleries.
2)Slideshow Capability.
3)HTML Content Support: ability to show websites or other HTML content in a lightbox.
4)Video Content Support.
5)Visual Effects: fancy pre-loader and transition when you click on the image.
6)Keyboard Shortcuts: useful keyboard shortcuts for switching between images, toggling play / pause, etc.
7)Zoom Capability: larger images are reduced in size so they fit snugly inside the browser window. A zoom in button can then be clicked on to see it in its original size, while a zoom out button is provided to return you to the scaled down version.
8)Choice of Layouts.
9)Skin and Animation Configuration.
10)Right-to-Left Language Support.
11)Automatic Image Detection: configurable automatic re-formatting of image node thumbnails, previews, etc, so there is no need to add 'rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;' to each image node link on your site. Image, Inline, Flickr, Acidfree Albums, Image Assist, Embedded Media Field and CCK Imagefield modules are all supported.
12)Page Exclusion Capability: exclude certain pages on your site from having the lightbox2 functionality.
13)Login Support: ability to modify all user/login links so the login form appears in a lightbox.
14)Gallery 2 Support: support for Gallery 2 images via the Gallery module (beta). See here for information on how to customise your Gallery2 theme to work with lightbox.

Integrating with git checkouts

This module is based on concepts very similar to Drupal core's update module. Modules and themes with their corresponding drupal.org projects are identified and translations are downloaded for the appropriate versions. If you use git checkouts instead of package tarballs or zip files, use Git deploy module, so projects and versions are identified properly. (For legacy CVS checkouts, the CVS deploy module will work).

            <document documentType="DESCRIPTION">
                <content>Nodequeue module allows users to collect nodes in an arbitrarily ordered list. The order in the list can be used for a any purpose, such as:

1)A block listing teasers for the five top news stories on a site.
2)A user’s favorite music albums.
3)A group of favorite from which one is randomly displayed.

Nodequeue provides a simple drag-and-drop interface to manually order any queue. Additionally, it allows nodes to be added and removed from queues without needing edit permissions to the node. Nodes can be added to queues either from a queue management tab or by links on the node teaser.

Smartqueue API:

Nodequeue provides a robust API that allows other modules to define smartqueues, which are associated with external data. For example, the included taxonomy smartqueue creates subqueues for a given queue for every term in the chosen vocabulary. Nodes are then only eligible for subqueues whose term matches the nodes terms. This makes it very easy to have queues for each category without cluttering the management page.

            <document documentType="DESCRIPTION">
                <content>Panels module allows a site administrator to create customized layouts for multiple uses. At its core it is a drag and drop content manager that lets you visually design a layout and place content within that layout. Integration with other systems allows you to create nodes that use this, landing pages that use this, and even override system pages such as taxonomy and the node page so that you can customize the layout of your site with very fine grained permissions.

References will most probably be deprecated in the near future in favor of Entity Reference, which should probably be considered first on fresh D7 projects. Another, more radical, alternative would be the Relation module.

This project provides D7 versions of the 'Node reference' and 'User reference' field types, that were part of the CCK package in D6, at functional parity with the D6 counterparts. See http://drupal.org/node/533222 for details.</content>

provide a checklist that helps you keep track of what needs to be done
look to see what modules you already have installed and check them off for you automatically (thanks, EclipseGC!)
provide a list of things that you haven't done so that you can do them.
time/date stamp each item as you complete it so that you have a report that you can give your boss/client to show them how awesome you are that you've done all the SEO stuff
make you look like an SEO genius!

With this module, all you have to do is use the checklist and you'll know exactly what SEO stuff was done. It's more than just a list of stuff to do - it's a powerful organization tool, as well.

                <content>SpamSpan module obfuscates email addresses to help prevent spambots from collecting them.

It implements the technique at the SpamSpan website (a German version is also available). The problem with most email address obfuscators is that they rely upon JavaScript being enabled on the client side. This makes the technique inaccessible to people with screen readers. SpamSpan however will produce clickable links if JavaScript is enabled, and will show the email address as example [at] example [dot] com if the browser does not support JavaScript or if JavaScript is disabled.

This technique is unlikely to be absolutely foolproof. It is possible in theory for a determined spambot to harvest addresses from your site no matter how you disguise them. But research suggests that the by far the great majority of spambots do not bother to attempt to collect addresses which have been hidden using JavaScript. Indeed, most spambots cannot currently read JavaScript at all.

An example of such a variable is site_frontpage. In Drupal this defaults to node, which ensures that the front page gets content as soon as some exists, but for many Drupal sites this setting is simply wrong. Strongarm gives the site builder a place in the equation - an opportunity to set the site_frontpage to something that makes sense for their site.

Strongarm leverages ctools to provide exportables of Drupal variables. This branch also allows Strongarm to be used with the Features module. More information about this work is available on this blog post.</content>

                <content>Tokens provides a shared API for replacement of textual placeholders with actual data.Tokens are small bits of text that can be placed into larger documents via simple placeholders, like %site-name or [user]. The Token module provides a central API for modules to use these tokens, and expose their own token values.

Note that Token module doesn't provide any visible functions to the user on its own, it just provides token handling services for other modules.

For Drupal 6, the Token module provides a &quot;Token Actions&quot; module which can be enabled separately. This provides several &quot;actions&quot; for the Drupal core Actions/Trigger modules to use that take advantage of the Token replacement functionality.

Modules that use the Token module and provide tokens via the API include Organic Groups, Pathauto, Comment Notify, and Commerce. Also check out the full list of modules that use or provide tokens or the list of open issues tagged with 'token'.

6)Heck, you could rotate entire nodes, categories, image galleries, etc. I wouldn't suggest it, but you have that power.
7)Its also a great space saver. Places where you had multiple images or multiple items such as RSS feeds or category listings can now be presented in a slideshow.

The possibilities are really endless, as the more ways you can think of to categorize and add to views, the more you can rotate.

In our example, we could assign an action so that when the story moves from the Draft state to the Review state an email is sent out. Another action could be assigned to the transition from Review to Published so that the node's status is set to Published (and becomes visible on your website).</content>
